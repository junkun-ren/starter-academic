I am currently working at the Theoretical Ecology Group at Peking University in Beijing, China, and am applying for Ph.D. programs. I am particularly interested in understanding models and theories related to ecology and biology. My research interests include food-webs, coexistence, and stability. I am also interested in applying mathematical modeling to questions like infectious disease transmission intervention. 

Prior to working at the theoretical ecology lab at Peking University, I worked as a research assistant at the Space Medicine Lab at Dartmouth College, doing data and epidemiological analyses. I studied epidmeiology at Harvard University and food science & engineering at Shanghai Jiaotong Univerisity, during which I developed good quantitative skills.
